System configuration:

	Cygnal on Windows 10

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.5.2

Installer:

	Art Eschenlauer
	University of Minnesota

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	Icon programs can only run from a Cygwin terminal or with the
  CygNAL cygwin1.dll exactly matching the cygwin1.dll used to
  build the binaries. See
    http://www.kylheku.com/cygnal
  and
    https://github.com/eschen42/portableIcon
  for more info.

  By default, this configuration is not intended to support
  graphics; configuration with graphics has not been tested.

	The "options" test fails because profiling needs a Unix timer.

	The "kwds" test fails because it does not expect &progname
  to end in .exe.

Comments:

	See the special Cygwin page in the documentation directory.

	Tested on Cygwin-NT-10.0 (v3.2.0) with GCC 10.2.0.
